# README
A quiz website made by Adrian Rivera (@arBalasquide) for Puerto Rico History class

The base code was taken form https://codepen.io/gcarino/pen/LDgtn and the following was modified and/or added:

- Questions are randomly selected
- You cannot go to the next question until you get it correct
- Multiple Choices get greyed out if you get them incorrect and cannot submit the same answer again
- The div container shakes when you get the answer wrong and deducts -1 from the total points
- Changed the scoring system from how many you got right to +1 for each correct one to -1 for each incorrect answer
- Edited the CSS to add a Puerto Rico theme and change the color/font schemes
- Added an alert for mobile users to use their device in landscape mode for a better view of the website
